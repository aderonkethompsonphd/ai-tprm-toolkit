## Section 5 — Accuracy, Robustness, and Security

- [ ] What accuracy/performance metrics apply to this system? (Provide benchmark results)
- [ ] Has the system been tested for adversarial inputs / adversarial robustness?
- [ ] Is there a documented process for handling model errors and hallucinations?
- [ ] Is the system tested for prompt injection (for LLM/agentic systems)?
- [ ] Does the system have a Cryptography Bill of Materials (CBOM)? (Especially if handling sensitive data)
- [ ] What is the process for model updates and version management?

---

## Section 6 — Agentic AI Specific (if applicable)

- [ ] Does the system operate autonomously over extended periods (agentic)?
- [ ] List all tools/APIs the system can call:
- [ ] What actions can the system take in the real world (send email, write files, call APIs)?
- [ ] Is an Agentic System BOM available? (SBOM + AIBOM + Runtime + Behaviours)
- [ ] What runtime evidence (audit logs) does the system produce?
- [ ] Are human approval checkpoints defined for high-risk actions?
- [ ] What are the defined constraints on the system's autonomous behaviour?
